Any advice for software engineers trying to figure out where their role should be?

--- What are you most proud of?

Infrastructure I built, testing architecture is whats being used right now as basement for a long term project





--- What was the most challenging of the project?


Technical challenge - Learning intricacies of a new software within the stipulated time of a project. 

Often times you are put on a project where you have, say, 6 months to execute it but the technology you'll be working on is not your area of expertise and then you have to spend time learning it within a month or so. This is particularly tough, especially when you are dealing with several unique concepts all at once.
