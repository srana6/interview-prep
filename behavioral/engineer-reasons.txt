What made you become a software engineer?

Almost when I was around 8y old, I found it was my passion while attending Artificial Intelligence class of my sister. 
I enjoy creating things from scratch or making them better.




What excites you the most?


I got to know more about Uber by attending to an event at University. It excites me to see in practice that anyone can effect a real change in the company if promotes the idea till make it happen.

I want to improve mentorship, continuing education classes, and create avenues by which people can improve anything on either the personal or technical side,
